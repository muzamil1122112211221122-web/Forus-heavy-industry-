# Fix Vercel 404 Error - Updated Configuration

## The Problem
Vercel shows 404 "This page could not be found" because the build configuration wasn't pointing to the correct output directory.

## Solution: Updated Configuration

I've fixed your `vercel.json` file with the correct settings:

### Key Changes:
1. **Build source**: Changed from `client/**/*` to `package.json`
2. **Routes**: Updated to point to `/dist/public/$1` instead of `/client/$1`
3. **Static build**: Properly configured for Vite output directory

## Steps to Deploy the Fix:

### Method 1: Update via GitHub (Recommended)
1. **Upload the updated `vercel.json`** to your GitHub repository
2. **In Vercel dashboard**, click "Redeploy" on your project
3. **Wait for build to complete** (3-4 minutes)
4. **Your app should now work**

### Method 2: Manual Vercel Settings
If GitHub update doesn't work, manually configure in Vercel:

**Project Settings:**
- **Framework Preset**: Other
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

**Environment Variables (Required):**
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY_1` = your primary API key
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY_2` = your secondary API key
- `NODE_ENV` = production

## Alternative: Try Railway Instead

If Vercel continues having issues, Railway works better for full-stack apps:

1. **Go to railway.app**
2. **Connect your GitHub repository**
3. **Railway auto-detects** the configuration
4. **Add the same environment variables**
5. **Deploy automatically**

## Test Your Fixed Deployment

Once redeployed, your app should:
- Show the Forus Heavy API interface
- Load without 404 errors
- Connect to AI APIs properly
- Have all features working

The updated configuration should resolve the 404 error and get your app running properly on Vercel.
