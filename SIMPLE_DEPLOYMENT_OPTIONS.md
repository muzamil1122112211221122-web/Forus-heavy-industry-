# Simple Deployment Options - Multiple Platforms

Since Vercel is having issues, here are 3 alternative platforms that work better:

## Option 1: Netlify (Easiest for Static Sites)

### Steps:
1. **Go to netlify.com** → Sign up with GitHub
2. **Click "New site from Git"** → Connect your repository
3. **Build settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`
4. **Add environment variables**:
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY_1` = your API key
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY_2` = your secondary API key
5. **Deploy** - Usually works on first try

## Option 2: Railway (Best for Full-Stack)

### Steps:
1. **Go to railway.app** → Sign up with GitHub
2. **Click "New Project"** → Deploy from GitHub repo
3. **Select your repository** → Railway auto-detects settings
4. **Add environment variables** in Railway dashboard
5. **Deploy automatically** - Works great with WebSocket

## Option 3: Render (Free Alternative)

### Steps:
1. **Go to render.com** → Sign up with GitHub
2. **New Web Service** → Connect repository
3. **Settings**:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
4. **Add environment variables**
5. **Deploy**

## Quick Fix for Current Vercel Issue

If you want to try Vercel one more time:

### Updated Vercel Settings:
- **Framework**: Other
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

### Environment Variables (All Platforms):
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY_1` = your primary API key
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY_2` = your secondary API key
- `NODE_ENV` = production

## Recommendation: Try Railway First

Railway is the most reliable for full-stack apps like yours:
- Automatically detects Node.js apps
- Handles both frontend and backend
- Great WebSocket support
- Simple environment variable setup
- Usually deploys successfully on first try

All three alternatives should work better than the current Vercel configuration issues.
